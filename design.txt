Sparrow design (14-Oct-2015)
1. Implement SCIM 2.0 using Mavibot for storage
2. Add complete RBAC support using Fortress
3. Support OpenIDConnect

The end goal is to make it an alternative for LDAP by supporting
fast reads, ACID writes, and namespaces/domains

How about storing ppolicy data in a separate index, keyed by either username or resource's ID?
This might boost the performance by avoiding deserializing resource data and applying schema.
